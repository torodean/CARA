The \textbf{Changelog Automation \& Release Assistant (CARA)} is a command-line tool designed to automate the process of generating and maintaining changelogs using Git commit history. CARA parses Git logs and formats the output according to a customizable configuration, allowing users to streamline their release documentation process.

CARA supports multiple verbosity levels, debug output, and configurable input/output paths, making it adaptable to a variety of development workflows. It is intended for developers who maintain changelogs regularly and prefer consistency, automation, and clarity in their version history tracking.
